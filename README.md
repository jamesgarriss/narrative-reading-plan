# Narrative Reading Plan
The purpose of this repo is to provide a Bible reading plan that is:
* **Chronological** -- It presents the events in the Bible in the order they happened, which is not always the order in which they are arranged in our English translations.  
* **Narrative-centric** -- Narratives are easiest passages to see God working in redemptive history.  This plan removes a lot of passages that make Bible reading difficult (e.g., Leviticus). 
* **Non-repetitive** -- When the same events are recorded it different books, it uses one or the other, but not both.
Hopefully this plan will enable readers to see the big picture of God's plan as it unfold throughout the story of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.
## Old Testament
### Creation and the Fall
God created the world, and it was good. The pinnacle of his creation was man, but Adam sinned and broke his relationship with God. In his justice, God punished Adam; in his grace, he promised that there would be a descedent from Eve who would strike a fatal blow to the serpent who tempted Eve. Who would be that promised descendent?
* [Gen 1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+1&version=HCSB)
### Adam
Would the promised one be Adam's son, Able? No, instead, the effects of sin increase as murder and death enter the world.  God, however, was faithful to his promise by giving Eve another son, Seth.
* [Gen 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+4&version=HCSB)
* [Gen 5:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+5&version=HCSB)
### Noah and the Flood
As fallen angels (the sons of God) procreated with women, sin began to dominate the entire human race.  Though God punished sin, he was faithful to his promise by saving Noah.
* [Gen 6-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+6&version=HCSB)
### Abram and the Covenant
In Babylon, men tried to reached heaven on their own, so God confused their language.  God made a covenant with Abram and promised that he would bless everyone on the earth through him.  The promised descendent would come from Abram.

As Abram (mostly) obeyed God, God renewed his covenant and promised him a land where his offspring would one day dwell. God was faithful to keep his covenant by enabling Abram's wife to conceive at an old age.
* [Gen 15-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+15&version=HCSB)

* [Gen 21-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+24&version=HCSB)

* [Gen 26-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+26&version=HCSB)
