# Narrative Reading Plan
The purpose of this repo is to provide a Bible reading plan.  This plan is **chronological**; it presents the events in the Bible in the order they happened, which is not necessarily the order in which they are arranged in our English translations.  It focuses upon the **narratives** of the Bible; this makes it easier to see God working in redemptive history, and it also removes a lot of passages that make Bible reading difficult (e.g., Leviticus).  It is **non-repetitive**; when the same events are recorded it different books, it uses one or the other, but not both.
