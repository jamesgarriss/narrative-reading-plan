# Narrative Reading Plan
The purpose of this repo is to provide a Bible reading plan that is:
* **Chronological** -- It presents the events in the Bible in the order they happened, which is not always the order in which they are arranged in our English translations.  
* **Narrative-centric** -- Narratives are easiest passages to see God working in redemptive history.  This plan removes a lot of passages that make Bible reading difficult (e.g., Leviticus). 
* **Non-repetitive** -- When the same events are recorded it different books, it uses one or the other, but not both.

As reader follow this plan, it is hoped that they will be able to see the big picture of God's plan as it unfolds throughout the story of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.
## Old Testament
### Creation and the Fall
God created the world, and it was good. The pinnacle of his creation was man, who he made in his image.
* [Gen 1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+1-2&version=HCSB)
### The Fall
Adam sinned and broke his relationship with God. In his justice, God punished Adam; in his grace, he promised that there would be a descedent from Eve who would strike a fatal blow to the serpent who tempted Eve. Who would be that promised descendent?
* [Gen 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+3&version=HCSB)
### Adam
Would the promised one be Adam's son, Cain? No, instead, the effects of sin appeared as murder and death enter the world.  God, however, was faithful to his promise by giving Eve another son, Seth.
* [Gen 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+4&version=HCSB)
* [Gen 5:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+5%3A1-3&version=HCSB)
### Noah and the Flood
As fallen angels (the sons of God) procreated with women, sin began to dominate the entire human race.  Though God punished sin, he was faithful to his promise by saving Noah.
* [Gen 6-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+6-9&version=HCSB)
### Abram and the Covenant
In Babylon, men tried to reached heaven on their own, so God confused their language.  God made a covenant with Abram and promised that he would bless everyone on the earth through him.  The promised descendent would come from Abram.
* [Gen 11:1-9, 27-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+11%3A1-9%2C+27-32&version=HCSB)
* [Gen 12-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+12-14&version=HCSB)
### Abram and the Promise of Land
As Abram (mostly) obeyed God, God renewed his covenant and promised him a land where his offspring would one day dwell. God was faithful to keep his covenant by enabling Abram's wife to conceive at an old age.
* [Gen 15-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+15-20&version=HCSB)
### Isaac
Would the promised one be Abram's son, Isaac? No, but God was faithful to keep his covenant by providing Isaac with a wife.
* [Gen 21-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+21-24&version=HCSB)
### Jacob
Would the promised one be Isaac's son, Jacob? No, though God was faithful to keep his covenant by protecting Jacob from Laban and Esau.
* [Gen 25:19-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+25%3A19-35&version=HCSB)
* [Gen 26-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+26-35&version=HCSB)
### Joseph
Would the promised one be Isaac's favorite son, Joseph? No, his brothers sold him into slavery. God, however, was faithful to keep his covenant by using Joseph to save his entire family from starvation by bringing them down to Egypt.
* [Gen 37:1-46:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+37-46%3A5&version=HCSB)

### Moses
A new Pharoah came to power in Egypt, one who enslaved the Israelites. God was faithful to keep his covenenant by raising up Moses to deliver them.
* [Exo 1:1-6:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exo+1-6%3A13&version=HCSB)
### The Exodus
Pharoah refused to let the Israelites leave Egypt. God was faithful to keep his covenant by plaguing Egypt until Pharoah relented and by providing water and food in the wilderness.
* [Exo 6:26-18:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exo+6%3A26-Exo+18&version=HCSB)
### The Mosaic Covenant
God made a covenant with the nation of Israel, promising to be their God so long as they remained his obedient people. It didn't take long, however, for them to break the covenant by worshipping a golden idol, and God judged them for their sin. Knowing that his people would continue to sin, God was faithful to his covenant by selecting Aaron and his sons to be priests who would mediate between he and his people when they sinned.

* [Lev 8:1-10:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev+8%3A1-10%3A7&version=HCSB)
### The Wilderness
God was faithful to his covenant to Abraham and led the people with a cloud to Canaan, the land he had promised. The people did not trust God; they did not believe they he could help them defeat their enemies. As punishment, they were forced to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.

### Failure

* [Jdg 1-2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jdg+1&version=HCSB)
### The Cycle of Judges
With the death of Joshua there began a new period of time in Israel's history known as the judges.  It began when "another generation rose up who did not know the LORD" ([Jdg 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jdg+2%3A10&version=HCSB)) and was characterized by the fact that "everyone did whatever he wanted" ([Jdg 17:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jdg+17%3A6&version=HCSB)).  Trust in God was decreasing and immorality was increasing.  During this time there was a cycle that repeated itself again and again:  Israel sinned by breaking their coveneant, God punished them as had promised in the covenant, Israel repented of her sin, and God was faithful to keep the covenenant by delivering them with a judge. Some of these judges trusted God completely; perhaps one of them would be Eve's promised descendent.
* [Jdg 2:11-3:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jdg+2%3A11&version=HCSB)
* Othniel - [Jdg 3:7-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jdg+3%3A7-11&version=HCSB)
* Ehud - [Jdg 3:12-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jdg+3%3A12-30&version=HCSB)

* Gideon - [Jdg 6-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jdg+6-9&version=HCSB)
* Jephthah - [Jdg 10:6-12:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jdg+10%3A6&version=HCSB)
* Samson - [Jdg 13-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jdg+13&version=HCSB)
### Ruth
Despite the many failures of the judges, God was faithful to his covenant.  During the time of Gideon, he providentially set in motion a plan that would provide Israel with her greatest leader, one who would serve God with his whole heart.  Strangely enough, that plan began with a woman from Moab.
* [Rut 1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ruth+1-4&version=HCSB)
